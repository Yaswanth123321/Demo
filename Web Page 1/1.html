It's been one and half year since the pandemic has began and we have lost many lives due to this pandemic.
Many people came forward to help the needy people and one of them who contributed most of his time to help
us is Mr.Sonu sood sir.When the government announced the nationwide lockdown in March 2020, many medical 
staff members as well as doctors had to deal with the risk of contracting COVID-19, work for long hours, 
and also put up with occupational distress and social stigma.With a view to assist them and provide a place
of stay, Sonu Sood opened the gates of his Juhu hotel in Mumbai.The coronavirus pandemic led to the closure
of most industries and businesses, which in turn resulted in widespread job losses and food insecurities.
However, the most affected amidst the crisis were the people working in the informal sector.Without regular
income, several contract and migrant workers were struggling to obtain even three-square meals a day.
The lockdown forced scores of migrants to get back to their hometowns. Owing to the lack of timely transport 
facilities,many set out to cover long distances on foot.Some even attempted to walk over 1,000 kilometres in 
the hope of reaching a safe space.Being a migrant himself, Sonu was able to empathise with their difficulties.
So, he began by persuading a group of migrants in Karnataka who were about to start their journey on foot. 
He later coordinated with the Karnataka and Maharashtra state governments to arrange for buses for these migrants
to go home and also got their medical clearances done.In the last three months, the actor has helped over 20,000 
migrants reunite with their families. Be it Jharkhand, Assam, Bihar or Odisha,Sonu Sood helped people get home 
through buses, trains, and in some instances, even by organising air tickets.He also introduced a toll-free helpline
number so that migrant workers could send in their requests.Sood’s wife, Sonali, said that the migrant crisis took an
 emotional toll on him. “He interacted with people closely and saw their pain, which affected him quite a bit,” she said.
“He was constantly working those days. Sometimes he would get up at 3am and respond to requests on Twitter. He did it with 
so much dedication and sincerity.”  </p>
